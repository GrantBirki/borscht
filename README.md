You can view the public statis page [here](https://borscht.birki.io/status) 🔗

## About 💡

This project was inspired due to the conflict in Ukraine which has spawned a massive community run DDoS attack against Russia owned internet domains.

I wanted to see just how many Russian sites are down due to DDoS attacks and how they trending health wise over time.

## Adding a New Domain ➕

If you have a new domain you wish to add to the monitor, please file an issue in this repo by clicking [here](https://github.com/GrantBirki/borscht/issues/new?labels=domain+request&template=domain-request.md&title=Domain+Request)

## Disclaimer ⚠️

This project does not condone or support DDoS attacks of any kind. In many countries, DDoS attacks are considered illegal.

The "borscht" project is strictly for educational purpose and security folks who are interested in learning more about DDoS attacks in light of current events.
